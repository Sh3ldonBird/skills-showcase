To refresh and expand upon my knowledge of the programming language, Python, I went ahead and followed along with "[Harvard CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python – Full University Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4&t=49013s).  
I listened to the entirety of the course during a 2500 mile drive from Las Vegas, NV to Daytona, FL.  
While in Daytona, I then went through the course again while writing out the coding examples. Reviewing everything I missed or needed another look at helped my goal to learn how to "speak" Python and other coding languages.
